the mean and log are not commutable\n\n2.  $\\text{Median}[\\log(y)] = \\log[\\text{Median}(y)]$ - the median and log are commutable\n\n### Interpretaton of model coefficients\n\nUsing @eq-log-y, the mean $\\log(y)$ for any given value of $x$ is $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$; however, this does **not** indicate that the mean of $y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}$ (see previous section).\nFrom the assumptions of linear regression, we assume that for any given value of $x$, the distribution of $\\log(y)$ is Normal, and therefore symmetric.\nThus the median of $\\log(y)$ is equal to the mean of $\\log(y)$, i.e $\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$.\n\nSince the log and the median are commutable, $\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\Rightarrow \\text{Median}(y) = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}$.\nThus, when we log-transform the response variable, the interpretation of the intercept and slope are in terms of the effect on the **median** of $y$.\n\n**Intercept**: The intercept is expected median of $y$ when the predictor variable equals 0.\nTherefore, when $x=0$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 = \\beta_0 \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nInterpretation: When $x=0$, the median of $y$ is expected to be $\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}$.\n\n**Slope**: The slope is the expected change in the median of $y$ when $x$ increases by 1 unit.\nThe change in the median of $y$ is\n\n$$\n\\exp\\{[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x]\\} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}} = \\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\n$$\n\nThus, the median of $y$ for $x+1$ is $\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}$ times the median of $y$ for $x$.\n\nInterpretation: When $x$ increases by one unit, the median of $y$ is expected to multiply by a factor of $\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}$.\n\n## Log-transformation on the predictor variable\n\nSuppose we fit a linear regression model with $\\log(x)$, the log-transformed $x$, as the predictor variable.\nUnder this model, we assume a linear relationship exists between $\\log(x)$ and $y$, such that $y \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x), \\sigma^2)$ for some $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$ and $\\sigma^2$.\nIn other words, we can model the relationship between $\\log(x)$ and $y$ using the model in #eq-log-x.\n\n$$\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)\n$$ {#eq-log-x}\n\n**Intercept**: The intercept is the mean of $y$ when $\\log(x) = 0$, i.e. $x = 1$.\n\nInterpretation: When $x = 1$ $(\\log(x) = 0)$, the mean of $y$ is expected to be $\\beta_0$.\n\n**Slope**: The slope is interpreted in terms of the change in the mean of $y$ when $x$ is multiplied by a factor of $C$, since $\\log(Cx) = \\log(x) + \\log(C)$.\nThus, when $x$ is multiplied by a factor of $C$, the change in the mean of $y$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(Cx)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)] &= \\beta_1 [\\log(Cx) - \\log(x)] \\\\[10pt] \n& = \\beta_1[\\log(C) + \\log(x) - \\log(x)] \\\\[10pt] \n& = \\beta_1 \\log(C)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus the mean of $y$ changes by $\\beta_1 \\log(C)$ units.\n\nInterpretation: When $x$ is multiplied by a factor of $C$, the mean of $y$ is expected to change by $\\beta_1 \\log(C)$ units.\nFor example, if $x$ is doubled, then the mean of $y$ is expected to change by $\\beta_1 \\log(2)$ units.\n\n## Log-transformation on the the response and predictor variable\n\nSuppose we fit a linear regression model with $\\log(x)$, the log-transformed $x$, as the predictor variable and $\\log(y)$, the log-transformed $y$, as the response variable.\nUnder this model, we assume a linear relationship exists between $\\log(x)$ and $\\log(y)$, such that $\\log(y) \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x), \\sigma^2)$ for some $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$ and $\\sigma^2$.\nIn other words, we can model the relationship between $\\log(x)$ and $\\log(y)$ using the model in @eq-log-x-y.\n\n$$\n\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)\n$$ {#eq-log-x-y}\n\nBecause the response variable is log-transformed, the interpretations on the original scale will be in terms of the median of $y$ (see the section on the log-transformed response variable for more detail).\n\n**Intercept**: The intercept is the mean of $y$ when $\\log(x) = 0$, i.e. $x = 1$.\nTherefore, when $\\log(x) = 0$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 = \\beta_0 \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nInterpretation: When $x = 1$ $(\\log(x) = 0)$, the median of $y$ is expected to be $\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}$.\n\n**Slope**: The slope is interpreted in terms of the change in the median $y$ when $x$ is multiplied by a factor of $C$, since $\\log(Cx) = \\log(x) + \\log(C)$.\nThus, when $x$ is multiplied by a factor of $C$, the change in the median of $y$ is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\exp\\{[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(Cx)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)]\\} &= \n\\exp\\{\\beta_1 [\\log(Cx) - \\log(x)]\\} \\\\[10pt] \n& = \\exp\\{\\beta_1[\\log(C) + \\log(x) - \\log(x)]\\} \\\\[10pt] \n& = \\exp\\{\\beta_1 \\log(C)\\} = C^{\\beta_1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the median of $y$ for $Cx$ is $C^{\\beta_1}$ times the median of $y$ for $x$.\n\nInterpretation: When $x$ is multiplied by a factor of $C$, the median of $y$ is expected to multiple by a factor of $C^{\\beta_1}$.\nFor example, if $x$ is doubled, then the median of $y$ is expected to multiply by $2^{\\beta_1}$.",
