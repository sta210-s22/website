To access computing resources for the introductory data science courses offered by the Duke University Department of Statistical Science, go to the [Duke Container Manager](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers) website, [cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers).

If this is your first time accessing the containers, click on `reserve STA210` on the *Reservations available* menu on the right.
You only need to do this once, and when you do, you'll see this container moved to the *My reservations* menu on the left.

Next, click on `STA210` under *My reservations* to access the RStudio instance you'll use for the course.
